# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
    The router contains all the SPA's routes for different url's views.  Inside an ember route, is where you'll find the model in which a route references for data to display it's appropriate view.
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember g route campus/boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md

    {{#link-to 'campus.boston'}}Boston Campus {{/link-to}}
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= 👀here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= 👀 here
    ```

    ```md
    I believe only the first one will properly route to the correct address, this is how we routed and sub-routed a URL yesterday.
    The first route will route to the product route and template, the second will route to the products route and template.  
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= 👀 here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    params.movie_id
    ```

1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
    we do so in the templates's corresponding route.js file which is created upon the ember g route <templatename> command
    ```
